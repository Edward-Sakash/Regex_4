"""make happy
Task
Make any face happy. Create a function that takes a sentence containing sad faces and turn them into happy ones! This involves changing only the mouths.
Make sure to only change the face if there are eyes before them, round(3.4) wouldn't become round)3.4) (for example).

Examples:
Sad face examples: ðŸ˜¦ 8( x( ðŸ˜­
Happy face examples: ðŸ˜ƒ 8) x) ðŸ˜‰

Hint:
you can use capture groups
or lookbehind assertion: research on (?<=.....)

Input / Output
make_happy("My current mood: :(")    -->    "My current mood: :)"  
make_happy("I was hungry 8(")        -->    "I was hungry 8)"  
make_happy("print('x(')")            -->    "print('x)')"  """
